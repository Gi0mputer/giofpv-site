# Project Completion Report: GioFPV Portfolio Site

## Overview
We have successfully transformed the GioFPV portfolio site into a premium, cinematic experience. The site now features a cohesive "Sunset" theme, optimized mobile layout, and a dynamic video gallery.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Visual Design & Branding
- **Sunset Theme**: Implemented a custom color palette (Amber, Orange, Sky Blue) inspired by golden hour tones.
- **Premium Typography**: Unified fonts and styling across all pages.
- **Gradient Accents**: Applied gradient text effects to key headings (About, Contact, Work).
- **Consistent Styling**: Standardized "eyebrow" labels (e.g., "Portfolio", "Contact") to a neutral gray for a clean look.

### 2. Hero Section (Mobile Optimized)
- **Full-Screen Experience**: The hero video now occupies `100svh` on mobile devices, providing an immersive first impression similar to `patrickfpv.com`.
- **Autoplay Video**: Background video plays smoothly with overlays.

### 3. Dynamic Video Gallery
- **Mixed Formats**: Successfully integrated both vertical (Shorts) and horizontal videos.
- **Verticals First**: Reordered the gallery to showcase vertical videos at the top.
- **Inline Playback**: Replaced external YouTube links with an inline video player, keeping users on the site.
- **Cinematic Thumbnails**: Replaced placeholder SVGs with high-quality, AI-generated cinematic drone shots.

### 4. Page Improvements
- **About Page**: Redesigned with a focus on readability and visual appeal. Replaced static images with a premium icon grid for collaborations.
- **Contact Page**: Fixed layout issues (email overflow), corrected color inconsistencies, and applied the premium design language.
- **Work Page**: Updated the header to match the new site aesthetic.

### 5. Technical & SEO
- **SEO**: Fixed hydration errors and ensured proper metadata.
- **Icons**: Integrated `lucide-react` for consistent and crisp iconography.
- **Performance**: Optimized image loading and component structure.

## Next Steps
- **Content**: Replace the AI-generated thumbnails with actual project screenshots when available.
- **Deployment**: The site is ready for deployment to a platform like Vercel or Netlify.
